## Files that are being used

The key config files that configure the different controllers of the arm models in the simulation are (in no particular order):

```test_joint_state_controller.yaml```, ```t_controllers.yaml```, ```t_list.yaml```, ```gazebo_ros_control_params.yaml```, ```joint_limits.yaml```, ```kinematics.yaml```

And the semantic description of the two UR10 models used in the simulation is manifested in ```test_dual.srdf``` which corresponds to the visual description in ```t_dual.urdf``` (in **dual_arm_description/urdf/**)
